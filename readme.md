# JavaScript, React, and Next.js Coding Tasks

This project contains solutions to various tasks using JavaScript, React, and Next.js, focusing on core web development concepts. It is divided into three main parts:

### Part 1 - JavaScript
Implements essential JavaScript functions, including:
1. **deepClone**: A function that performs a deep clone of an object.
2. **throttle**: A function to limit the rate at which a function can be invoked.
3. **fetchWithRetry**: A function that retries failed requests using exponential backoff.

### Part 2 - React
Showcases React skills with tasks involving functional components and hooks:
1. **TodoList Component**: A list of to-do items with functionality to mark as complete or delete.
2. **Controlled Form**: A form with fields for name and email, including validation.
3. **useLocalStorage Hook**: A custom hook for synchronizing state with local storage.

### Part 3 - Next.js
Explores Next.js capabilities with static and dynamic rendering:
1. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: A page that fetches and displays data from an external API.
2. **API Route**: Handles POST requests with data validation.
3. **Dynamic Route**: Displays item details based on the URL parameter.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Techniques to improve Next.js application performance.

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts and best practices in modern web development, utilizing JavaScript's functionality, React's interactivity, and Next.js's server-side capabilities.
